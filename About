🚀 Assignment 6 Completed: Security Audit of Internee.pk’s Website
Over the past few days, I worked on performing a security audit to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the security posture of Internee.pk. The focus was on ensuring data protection and preventing common cyber threats. 🔒
🔍 Key Areas Tested
 ✅ Login Pages & User Profiles
 ✅ APIs & Critical Web Endpoints
 ✅ Vulnerability Scanning with OWASP ZAP & Burp Suite
⚡ Vulnerabilities Explored
 💻 SQL Injection (SQLi) – manipulating queries to bypass authentication & extract data
 🌐 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – injecting malicious scripts into web pages
 🛡️ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – exploiting authenticated sessions to perform unauthorized actions
🧑‍💻 To practice and simulate real-world attacks, I also used OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for security training.
🔑 Takeaway: Security is not optional — it’s a necessity. Proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities helps protect users, data, and organizational trust.
